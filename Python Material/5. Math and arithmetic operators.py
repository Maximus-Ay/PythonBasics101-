'''
    Here we are going to see some functions in Mathematical module of python
    we have the 4 basic:
    Addition : +
    Subtraction: -
    Multiplication: *
    Division: /

    Others include the:
    Modulus : % 
    Exponent: **


'''

number = 12

number = number + 1 # Increment number by 1
number += 1 # Shortened form to increment number by 1. Augmented increment

number = number - 1 # reduce number by 1
number -= 1 # Shortened form to reducing number by 1.

number = number * 2 # multiply number by 2
number *= 2 # Shortened form

number = number / 3 # divide number by 3
number /= 1 # Shortened form 

number = number % 4 # Increment number by 1
number %= 1 # Shortened form 

number = number ** 1 # Increment number by 1
number **= 1 # Shortened form
