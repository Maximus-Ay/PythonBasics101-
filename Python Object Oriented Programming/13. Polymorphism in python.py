    POLYMORPHISM IN PYTHON
    => Polymorphism is word that originates from two greek words called: 
                   Poly = Many
                   Morphe = Forms
    => Hence Polymorphism means to have many forms or faces.
    => Polymorphism can be achieved in python using two concepts:
       1) Inheritance
       2) Duck typing
    => Here we will focus more on inheritance
'''

# HOW POLYMORPHISM IS ACHIEVED USING INHERITANCE
# Let;s say we have a parent class Shape and child classes: Square, Cicrle, Triangle
# when you create a cicle object it acts as both a circle and a shape since it inherits from 
# the Shape class, hence it has two forms and so polymorphism is achieved.
