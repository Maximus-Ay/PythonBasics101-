'''
    This program is a simple scientific calculator and will enable me to be able to be able
    to compress all basics of python needed to solve mathematical problems.
    The calculator will begin with a menu and will allows users choose and based on the menu, they
    will perform the different operation based on what the user wants.
    This calculator will perform 
    -> basic mathematical operations, 
    -> operations on Matrices,
    -> Vectors operations,
    -> solving simultaneous equations with two unknowns
    -> Solving simultaneous equations with three unknowns
    -> A small calculation game at the end of it all.
